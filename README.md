# Wator
Wator is a marine world where 2 types of species, fish and sharks coexist.

The female fish procreate with the male fish.
When a female fish procreates with a male, a new fish is generated that occupies that position, and the parents of this one must look for a position to settle down.

The male fish fight with other male fish and only one can remain.

When a female shark procreates with a male, a new shark is generated and occupies that position, and its parents must find a position to settle down.

Whether a shark falls in the position of a fish or a fish falls into the position of a shark, the shark will eat the fish.

This happens indefinitely in the world of Wator and it is possible to appreciate how the ecosystem changes constantly, but life always prevails.
